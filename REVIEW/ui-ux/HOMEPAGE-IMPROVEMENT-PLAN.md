# HOMEPAGE IMPROVEMENT PLAN
**Sites:** cleaning.vigilservices.co.uk · security.vigilservices.co.uk
**Reference:** `vigil-cleaning-homepage.html` and `vigil-security-homepage.html` committed to repos (June 2026)
**Note:** vigil-cleaning-homepage.html and vigil-security-homepage.html were referenced in AUTORUN-UI-UX-REVIEW.md as the target state. These files should be reviewed directly for final visual spec — this plan addresses the structural and UX gaps identified from code analysis.

## KEY IMPROVEMENT AREAS

### 1. HERO — NO VISUAL ELEMENT

The current hero is pure text. Every major competitor uses a photograph or illustration in the hero:
- Cleanology: professional commercial cleaning photograph, full bleed
- OCS: office environment photograph
- Mitie: diverse team photograph

Vigil's hero has:
- Quick Answer Block (good for SEO) ✓
- Strong headline ✓
- Good subhead ✓
- Good trust chips ✓
- Good CTAs ✓
- **No image** — text only

On desktop (1440px), the hero occupies approximately 300px of vertical space. It looks correct but lacks visual authority compared to photography-led competitors. For B2B buyers visiting from a Google search, first impressions happen in 50ms — a dark text-only page reads as "small business" vs a photo-backed hero that reads as "established company."

**Recommendation:** Once photography is available (see IMAGE-TASK.md), add a right-column image to the hero on desktop using a 2-column layout. On mobile, the image should be hidden or stacked below the CTAs. This matches the prototype referenced in the homepage HTML files.

### 2. QUALIFICATION FLOW PLACEMENT

The QualificationFlow appears immediately after the hero with no section heading or introduction. First-time visitors may not understand what the flow is before entering it.

**Recommendation:** Add a brief introduction above the flow:
```
SECTION TAG: "Find your solution"
H2: "Tell us about your business"
TL;DR: Our qualification takes 2 minutes and matches you to the right cleaning programme.
```
This frames the flow as a tool that benefits the user, not a form they fill in for Vigil's benefit.

### 3. MISSING TESTIMONIALS SECTION

Between "Why Vigil" (Section 5) and "Sectors" (Section 6), there should be a social proof section. The three testimonials already exist in QualificationFlow but are hidden.

**Proposed testimonials section:**
```
SECTION TAG: "What our clients say"
H2: "Trusted by facilities managers across London"
TL;DR: Clients cite consistent operatives and zero management overhead as the primary benefits.

```

### 4. SERVICE CARDS — EMOJI ICONS

The 6 service cards use emoji icons (🏢 🏗️ 🏥 🏘️ 🚧 ⚡). The Why Vigil cards use emoji (👥 🔐 📋 🔄).

Emoji render inconsistently across operating systems and platforms. On some Android devices, the emoji fonts differ significantly from Apple/Windows. More critically, emoji carry an informal visual register that mismatches the B2B professional buyer audience (facilities managers, property directors, main contractors).

**Recommendation:** Replace with SVG icons from the Tabler Icons library (already a dependency). Render as `<Icon color="#4ecdc4" size={24} />` style.

Suggested icon mapping:
- Office Cleaning: `IconBuilding`
- After Builders Cleaning: `IconTool`
- Healthcare: `IconHeartRateMonitor`
- Property Management: `IconBuildingEstate`
- Construction: `IconCrane`
- Emergency: `IconAlertTriangle`

### 5. SERVICE CARD REDUNDANT CTA TEXT

Each service card ends with `{svc.title} →` as a secondary CTA (e.g., "Office Cleaning London →"). This duplicates the card title and adds visual noise.

**Recommendation:** Replace with a consistent "Learn more →" or simply an arrow `→`. The card is already fully clickable.

### 6. HOMEPAGE SECTIONS WITHOUT H2 ARIA ASSOCIATION

The compliance strip (`app/page.tsx:496–508`) and sectors section have H2 headings associated via `aria-labelledby` IDs in some places. The compliance strip has no heading — it is a visual element only. This is acceptable.

The borough section H2 is "Commercial cleaning across all 32 London boroughs" — this is correct and keyword-rich ✓.

### 7. STATS BAR — "DBS" AS A STAT

The stats bar has four items: `32` boroughs · `100%` direct staff · `£5m` insurance · `DBS` enhanced.

The first three are numeric statistics. "DBS" is a credential, not a number. It breaks the visual pattern of the bar (which implies quantified values) and is less impactful as a stat.

**Recommendation:** Replace "DBS" stat with something measurable. Options (use only if verified):
- "3-month" rolling contracts (a contract term, not a count — but factual)
- "AWR" compliant (similar credential format to DBS — consistent)
- "£5m" is already there — consider "24/7" as a stat (24/7 cover available — true)

### 8. "HIGH CLIENT RETENTION" — VAGUE STAT

`QualificationFlow.tsx:259`: `<div className={s.statNum}>High</div>` with label "client retention".

"High" is not a stat. This was deliberately kept non-specific per the truthfulness rules in CLAUDE.md (no invented numbers). However, it reads as evasive or unfinished.

**Options:**
- Remove this stat entirely (show 2 stats instead of 3 in the welcome screen)
- Replace with "3-month" rolling contracts (factual, indicates commitment)
- Replace with a true statement: "100%" directly employed (already used elsewhere, but this reinforces the differentiator)

## SECURITY HOMEPAGE — ADDITIONAL ISSUES

The security homepage structure was not fully reviewed but the following apply from what was read:

1. **Same missing testimonials section** — SecurityQualificationFlow has inline testimonials hidden in the flow.
2. **No hero section** — the SecurityQualificationFlow is the entire above-fold experience. A hero with headline, trust chips, and CTAs should precede the flow.
3. **Same emoji/icon recommendation** applies.
4. **Nav CTA broken** — as noted in Navigation and Conversion audits.
